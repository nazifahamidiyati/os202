# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. File<br>
A file is a collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. Or file is a collection of logically related entities. From user’s perspective a file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage.<br>
> Data is a set of facts and statistics that can be operated, referred or analyzed. It can simply be a piece of information, a list of grocery items, or observations, a story or a description of a certain scenario.<br>
> Metadata is a data about data. Metadata shows basic information about data, which can make finding and working with specific instances of data easier. Metadata provides the information regarding organization of raw data. It may be created manually or by automatic information processing. Manual processed metadata is more accurate than automatic information processed one because automatic information processed metadata only contains file name, size, extension, time of creation and information about who created the file.<br>
> Buffering is an act of storing data temporarily in the buffer. It helps in matching the speed of the data stream between the sender and the receiver. If the speed of the sender’s transmission is slower than the receiver, then a buffer is created in the main memory of the receiver, and it accumulates the bytes received from the sender and vice versa.<br>

2. File Directory<br>
File directory is collection of files. The directory contains information about the files, including attributes, location and ownership. Much of this information, especially that is concerned with storage, is managed by the operating system. The directory is itself a file, accessible by various file management routines. Information contained in a directory are name, type, address, current length, maximum length, date last accessed, date last updated, owner id, protection information.<br>

3. Access Methods<br>
The information in the file can be accessed in several ways: <br>
> Sequential Access :  Information in the file is processed in order, one record after the other. This mode of access is by far the most common; for example, editors and compilers usually access files in this fashion.<br>
> Direct Access : the file is viewed as a numbered sequence of blocks or records. Thus, we may read block 14, then read block 53, and then write block 7. There are no restrictions on the order of reading or writing for a direct-access file. Direct-access files are of great use for immediate access to large amounts of information. Databases are often of this type.<br>

4. A Virtual File System (VFS)<br>
A virtual file system (VFS) is programming that forms an interface between an operating system's Kernel and a more concrete file system. It  manages the data storage and retrieval between the operating system and the storage sub-system. It gives applications access to different types of file systems and local and network storage devices. It separates file system generic operations from their implementation by defining a clean VFS interface. It is also based on a file-representation structure known as vnode, which contains a numerical designator needed to support network file systems. <br>

5. Memory Mapped<br>
As a CPU needs to communicate with the various memory and input-output devices (I/O) as we know data between the processor and these devices flow with the help of the system bus. In memory mapped every bus in common due to which the same set of instructions work for memory and I/O. Hence we manipulate I/O same as memory and both have same address space, due to which addressing capability of memory become less because some part is occupied by the I/O.
