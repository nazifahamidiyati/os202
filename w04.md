# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Address Binding]<br>
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. Logical address is address generated by CPU during execution whereas Physical Address refers to location in memory unit(the one that is loaded into memory)

2. [Logical Address]<br>
The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program’s perspective. The hardware device called Memory-Management Unit is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding physical address. 

3. [Physical Address]<br>
Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The term Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a Logical address space.

4. [Internal Fragmentation]<br>
Internal fragmentation happens when the memory is split into mounted sized blocks. Whenever a method request for the memory, the mounted sized block is allotted to the method. just in case the memory allotted to the method is somewhat larger than the memory requested, then the distinction between allotted and requested memory is that the Internal fragmentation. 

5. [External Fragmentation]<br>
External fragmentation happens when there’s a sufficient quantity of area within the memory to satisfy the memory request of a method. however the process’s memory request cannot be fulfilled because the memory offered is during a non-contiguous manner. Either you apply first-fit or best-fit memory allocation strategy it’ll cause external fragmentation. 

6. [PTE]<br>
In Operating System (Memory Management Technique : Paging), for each process page table will be created, which will contain Page Table Entry (PTE). This PTE will contain information like frame number (The address of main memory where we want to refer), and some other useful bits (e.g., valid/invalid bit, dirty bit, protection bit etc). This page table entry (PTE) will tell where in the main memory the actual page is residing.

7. [TLB]<br>
Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) contains page table entries that have been most recently used. Given a virtual address, the processor examines the TLB if a page table entry is present (TLB hit), the frame number is retrieved and the real address is formed. If a page table entry is not found in the TLB (TLB miss), the page number is used to index the process page table. TLB first checks if the page is already in main memory, if not in main memory a page fault is issued then the TLB is updated to include the new page entry.

8. [Address]<br>
Address generated by CPU is divided into :<br>
Page number(p): Number of bits required to represent the pages in Logical Address Space or Page number. <br>
Page offset(d): Number of bits required to represent particular word in a page or page size of Logical Address Space or word number of a page or page offset.

9. [Physical Address]<br>
Physical Address is divided into :<br>
Frame number(f): Number of bits required to represent the frame of Physical Address Space or Frame number. <br>
Frame offset(d): Number of bits required to represent particular word in a frame or frame size of Physical Address Space or word number of a frame or frame offset.

10. [Multilevel Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Multilevel Paging is a paging scheme which consist of two or more levels of page tables in a hierarchical manner. It is also known as hierarchical paging. The entries of the level 1 page table are pointers to a level 2 page table and entries of the level 2 page tables are pointers to a level 3 page table and so on. The entries of the last level page table are stores actual frame information. Level 1 contain single page table and address of that table is stored in PTBR (Page Table Base Register).
